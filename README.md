# Tesla Clone Vite Project

Welcome to my Tesla Clone project, a sleek and responsive web application that mirrors the aesthetics and functionality of the official Tesla website. This project is built with modern web technologies and designed to provide a smooth user experience, closely resembling the look and feel of Tesla's own digital presence.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A blazing fast build tool that offers an optimized development experience by serving code via native ES modules, enabling lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components, ensuring dynamic and interactive experiences.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center`, and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **Git for Version Control**: Efficiently handled project versioning to track changes and collaborate with others.
